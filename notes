Diary - what does it do and therefore what should I test?

A diary can add a new entry to a list given some parameters
A diary can create an index of the diary entries
An entry doesn't currently do anything but a diary is dependent on it



Hello - what does it do and therefore what should I test?

EmailClient just creates a new message - dependent on Message
Message can send an email so we can call Message.send
SayHelloToMyLittleFriend.run will create a new EmailClient and then send that

Sooo.. to test the "run" method, we need to:
- have a double for a Message so that we can send a message without that class
- have a double for the EmailClient class so that we can pass in the message_class_double


message_double = double :message
message_class_double = double :message_class, new: message_double
emailclient_class_double = double :emailclient_class, new: message_class_double

say_hello = SayHelloToMyLittleFriend.new(emailclient_class_double)
